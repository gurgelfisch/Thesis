This is the code I used in my master's thesis with the title “Pocket Change: Answering East Africa`s Quest for Prosperity through Mobile Money”. 
I conducted an instrumental variable approach.
I used survey data from 2017 provided by Research ICT Africa in combination with Geodata on mobile money agent locations provided by Finmark in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda.
